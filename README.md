Office Hours
============

## Overview

Provides a web-based interface for requesting help during office hours. Allows students to find others with similar problems, or simply get help from a TA or lab assistant.


## Installation

1. Use pip to install all the dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Execute the following command from `shell.py`: `db.create_all()`. This should create a database called `app.db` in the repository directory.
3. Run the server using the platform of your choice, or simply `python run.py`.

## Workflow

There is more documentation within `oh_queue/README.md`.
